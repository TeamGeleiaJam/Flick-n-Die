<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This a small project developed for itch.io's Weekly Game Jam 184, themed 'Thumb Wars'. It was developed by a team of 7 game development students from PUC Minas. It is a video game built using Unity, with assets and code authored by ourselves, aswell as some commercially-available plugins. Flick n' Die is a chaotic game based on flicking dangerous objects with your hand towards your opponent: a fierce, vile hand! You can face off your foe in a multitude of arenas, and kill him in a number of crazy, flickin' ways.

### Built With
Flick n' Die and its assets were built using the following software (Please software may be added to this section during development):
* [Unity](https://unity.com/)
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

You can control your hand's movement using the WASD or arrow keys, and flick objects by holding down spacebar or the left mouse button.
